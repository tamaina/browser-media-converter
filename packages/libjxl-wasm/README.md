# @browser-mc/libjxl-wasm

Private package containing patched libjxl v0.11.1, a Rust planar session/CMS,
a C++ C ABI bridge, and the `createEncoder` TypeScript API. No package dependencies
or pnpm install are needed. Root workspace builds do not require Emscripten.

```

`patches/libjxl-xyb.patch` adds planar input plumbing and the fused YUV→XYB
SIMD kernel. `patches/libjxl-external-cms.patch` adds `JPEGXL_EXTERNAL_CMS`:
encoder builds use a rejecting default CMS stub and the bridge installs the
Rust CMS with `JxlEncoderSetCms`. The CMS uses moxcms pinned to `=0.9.2` for
LUT ICC profiles. Only Highway and Brotli submodules are needed; populated
source trees are reused without a network fetch.

## Build and test

Run from this package, sequentially. Emscripten defaults to
`~/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh` (`EMSDK_ENV` overrides it); `CMAKE` overrides CMake.
Emscripten's `--emit-tsd` also requires an existing `tsc` executable on `PATH`.
Add an installed TypeScript toolchain to `PATH`; there is no need to install
dependencies in this package. Node executes the API and tests without `tsc`.

```sh
export TMPDIR="$(cd ../.. && pwd)/build/tmp"
export EM_CACHE="$PWD/build/em-cache"
export CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$PWD/target"
export EMCC_CORES=1 CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=1
# Use the host compiler rather than an ambient cc wrapper.
export CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_UNKNOWN_LINUX_GNU_LINKER=/usr/bin/gcc
mkdir -p "$TMPDIR" "$EM_CACHE"
cargo test --lib --locked --jobs 1
bash scripts/build-wasm.sh
node --test --test-isolation=none --test-concurrency=1 test/api.test.ts
```

The Wasm entry builds the Rust staticlib, patched libjxl, then links
`build/wasm/codec.mjs` and `codec.wasm` using `em++ --emit-tsd build/wasm/codec.d.ts`.
An identical `codec.d.mts` accompanies the `.mjs` file for TypeScript module
resolution. It retains the `extern "C"` ABI, `EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS`, and ESM `createModule`
factory. No Embind is used. `sizes.json` records raw and gzip sizes.

Node 26 runs `src/api.ts` and the tests with built-in type stripping. The
package exports the TypeScript source and public types together; browser
consumers need a TypeScript-aware bundler. `./codec.mjs` exports the generated
module with its generated declaration. Keep the codec runtime and generated declarations together.
No hand-maintained low-level `_w_*` declarations are used.

For optional native tools, run `bash scripts/build-native.sh` (one job by
default). This builds the patched encoder library, a separate reference decoder
using system LCMS2, and `build/decode-float`. To link the native Rust cdylib,
set `JXL_INCLUDE="$PWD/build/libjxl/lib/include"` and
`JXL_LIBRARY="$PWD/build/native/lib/libjxl.so"` before `cargo build --locked --jobs 1`.
Without `JXL_INCLUDE`, Cargo builds the standalone Rust session/CMS; C ABI calls
are resolved by the final C++ link. For the optional guard-page tool:

```sh
PLANAR_SESSION_ONLY=1 cargo rustc --lib --release --locked --jobs 1 --crate-type staticlib
PLANAR_SESSION_LIB="$CARGO_TARGET_DIR/release/libjxl_planar_session.a" bash scripts/build-tail-guard.sh
./build/tail-guard
```

## Use

```ts
import {createEncoder} from '@browser-mc/libjxl-wasm';
const encoder = await createEncoder();
const bytes = encoder.encodeRgb({width: 1, height: 1, data: new Uint8Array([64, 128, 192])});
```

## HDR base

Planar BT.2020 primaries + BT.2020 NCL, 10/12-bit I420/I422/I444 accepts
`transfer: 'pq' | 'hlg'` (aliases `smpte2084` / `arib-std-b67`). It uses the
non-fused row/CMS path. 8-bit HDR, BT.709 matrices, P3 HDR and `encodeRgb` HDR
are rejected (including an 8-bit output override; float32 output remains available). HDR is recorded with PQ/HLG enum encoding; HDR ICC input is out
of scope. HDR with `iccHeader: 'bt2020' | 'p3'` or `iccFallback: 'srgb'` is rejected.

`intensityTargetNits` on input or encode options (options win) is variable for
HDR and SDR. Defaults are PQ 10000, HLG 1000, SDR 255 nits. Values must be
positive and finite within the JXL header's F16 range, `2^-24..65504` nits.
The CMS and XYB use this intensity as well as the header; PQ retains absolute
luminance, whereas HLG's display OOTF depends on this peak. The header truncates
to F16 precision, so arbitrary fractional targets may read back slightly lower.
`colorResolved.intensityTarget` (also in `encoder.stats.colorResolved`) reports
the float32 setting. `colorResolved.policy` is `hdr-as-is` for HDR, `sdr-as-is`
for SDR. There is no `hdrMode` option and no HDR→SDR tone mapping.

Default `validation: 'clip'` clips reconstructed RGB to [0,1] for HDR as for SDR
and emits a policy warning without an additional pixel scan. `strict` rejects
out-of-range values. `masteringDisplay` and `contentLightLevel` produce warnings
and are **not stored** (MDCV/CLLI); `min_nits` and other fields are not repurposed.

### Straight alpha

`encodeRgb({width, height, data, alphaMode: 'straight'})` accepts RGB/RGBA
U8/U8Clamped/U16/Float32. Omission means straight; other explicit modes fail.
Alpha is separate from colour, never passed through ICC/CMS, and retains the
source type's 8/16/32-bit depth (Float32: 8 exponent bits). Colour `bitDepth`
does not change alpha depth. libjxl's default extra-channel distance is zero,
so alpha is lossless even with colour distance 1. Fully transparent colour
may be simplified by the default libjxl `KEEP_INVISIBLE` policy. The fused
colour and row paths remain available with a separate alpha extra channel.

Planar alpha uses `format: 'I420A' | 'I422A' | 'I444A'` and AP10/AP12 variants,
with full-resolution `planes[3]`. Alpha uses full range and source depth 8/10/12
regardless of YUV range or output colour depth. The standard extra-channel path
copies/quantizes alpha; SDR colour still uses the fused SIMD kernel, and HDR
keeps its existing row/CMS path. No extra full-image opacity/range scan is added.
The 64 MiB source-span cap includes the alpha plane.

The names/layouts are confirmed against [WebCodecs §9.8](https://www.w3.org/TR/2026/WD-webcodecs-20261026/#pixel-format)
and the repository's webcodecs-color descriptors. In tested Chrome 156, raw
VideoFrame alpha formats accept 8/10-bit but reject AP12 enum values; direct
12-bit plane encoding works. WebCodecs alpha association semantics are
**unconfirmed** in this work; callers must supply straight samples.


## JPEG XL animation (feature 5)

`encodeAnimation` accepts already-decoded, composited full-canvas SDR RGB/RGBA
frames. GIF/APNG decoding is out of scope; callers resolve disposal, blending,
frame rectangles and source loop conventions before passing frames.

```js
const animation = encoder.encodeAnimation({
  width, height, format: 'RGBA', loops: 0,
  frames: [
    {data: firstRgba, durationMs: 100},
    {data: secondRgba, durationMs: 150},
  ],
}, {distance: 1, effort: 3, bitDepth: 8});
```

All frames share dimensions, channel count, source depth and colour settings.
U8/U8Clamped, full-range U16 and Float32 inputs follow `encodeRgb` semantics,
including straight alpha and ICC fallback. Frames replace the entire canvas
without inter-frame reuse; output may be much larger than the source GIF/APNG.
`loops` is the JPEG XL loop count (0 = infinite, positive = total plays), not
necessarily the loop field of a source GIF/APNG. Durations must be positive and
finite; they round to milliseconds with a minimum of 1 and maximum of uint32.
Limits: 1–256 frames, 4 megapixels per frame. Source frames are copied into WASM
one at a time; encoded output chunks accumulate until the file is assembled.
Planar/HDR animation, animation XYB observation (`observe`) and `rgbViaPlanar`
are unsupported. The latter two options are rejected. `AnimationFrame` and
`AnimationEncodeOptions` are exported; `frames` accepts readonly arrays.

The bridge creates one encoder and CMS per sequence. `JxlBasicInfo.have_animation`
is true, ticks per second are `1000/1`, and `num_loops` is `loops`. Each
`JxlFrameHeader.duration` is the rounded `durationMs`. Only the final frame calls
`JxlEncoderCloseFrames` / `JxlEncoderCloseInput`; the owned output chunks are
concatenated into one JPEG XL file (bare codestream or container). Failure releases
encoder/CMS state, and ICC fallback restarts the whole sequence with a common sRGB header.
`encoder.stats` adds `frameCount`, `loops` and `durationsMs`; `encodeMs` and
`totalMs` cover the sequence, and `heapBefore` is sampled before the sequence
begins. Failed animations restore the previous stats. Other detailed counters
describe the final frame.

Run `pnpm test:api` here after building WASM. Still-image and WASM-only animation
checks need no native toolchain. Independent decode checks lazily compile
`tools/inspect_animation.cc` with `CXX` (default `c++`). They use the local
`build/native/lib/libjxl.so` if present, otherwise `pkg-config --cflags --libs libjxl`.
Set `JXL_LIBRARY` to a libjxl library file and `JXL_INCLUDE` to its header directory
to override local discovery. Missing compiler, headers or library cause only the
native decode checks to skip with a diagnostic. The decoder checks frame counts,
timing, loop metadata, RGB/RGBA pixels and valid RGB/Gray ICC sequences.
Playback in browser image renderers is not covered by this Node decoder test.
